# Trading Interface Overview

The `trading_interface/` folder houses the static marketing site that introduces MarketMinerAI.

## Files

- `index.html` – Entry point for the MarketMinerAI landing page.
- `styles.css` – Styling for the landing page.
- `script.js` – Client-side interactions for the page.

The automation logic now lives in the top-level `automation/` directory alongside detailed setup notes. Keeping the web assets
and trading script separate makes it easier to maintain each component independently.
