# Trading Interface Overview

The `trading_interface/` folder houses the static marketing site and the Solana automation helper script used by MarketMinerAI.

## Files

- `index.html` – Entry point for the MarketMinerAI landing page.
- `styles.css` – Styling for the landing page.
- `script.js` – Client-side interactions for the page.
- `finalDraftV3.py` – Solana trading assistant that listens for balance updates and attempts automated buy/sell orders through Pump.fun and Raydium when wallet changes are detected.

No application logic was modified as part of this organization; the goal is solely to highlight the Python automation alongside the web assets.
