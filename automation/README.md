# Automation Script

The `finalDraftV3.py` module powers MarketMinerAI's automated trading capabilities. It listens for configured Solana wallet
activity, tracks liquidity events, and attempts synchronized orders against Pump.fun and Raydium once movement is detected.

## Overview

- **Event-driven execution:** Reacts to wallet balance updates and on-chain signals rather than relying on timed polling.
- **Strategy hooks:** Encapsulates helper functions so you can adjust entry, exit, and sizing logic without rewriting the
  orchestration layer.
- **Third-party integrations:** Communicates with Pump.fun and Raydium endpoints to route trades based on the latest market data.

## Getting Started

1. Create a Python virtual environment if you have not already:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the dependencies that the script expects (consult the source to identify requirements such as `requests` or Solana
   client libraries).
3. Configure any environment variables, API keys, and wallet credentials referenced inside the script.
4. Launch the automation from the repository root:
   ```bash
   python automation/finalDraftV3.py
   ```

## Customization Tips

- Update the helper functions handling Pump.fun and Raydium calls to enforce tighter risk controls.
- Add structured logging or integrations with your monitoring tooling for better observability.
- Introduce retries and circuit breakers around external API calls to harden the automation for production workloads.
