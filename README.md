# ‚ö° SolSync  
**AI-Enhanced Copy-Trading Bot on the Solana Blockchain**

> Mirror smart trades. Execute faster. Trade smarter.  

SolSync is a **Python-based automated trading bot** built on the **Solana blockchain**, designed to **mirror the trades of selected master wallets** in real time.  
It leverages **RPC APIs**, **Web3.py**, and advanced concurrency logic to deliver **low-latency, fail-safe copy-trading** for decentralized markets.

## üöÄ Project Overview  

SolSync automates trade replication by continuously tracking a target trader‚Äôs on-chain activity and instantly executing mirrored transactions.  
It‚Äôs optimized for **speed, reliability, and security**, integrating **real-time transaction monitoring**, **multi-threaded execution**, and **blockchain analytics** to ensure efficient synchronization.

## üí° Key Features  

- **Copy-Trading Engine**  
  Monitors blockchain transaction streams and mirrors trades from a designated wallet with configurable thresholds, filters, and delay tolerances.

- **Low-Latency Execution**  
  Optimized event loops reduce replication lag by up to **30%**, ensuring precise and timely execution of trades while minimizing slippage.

- **Secure Blockchain Interaction**  
  Implements **Web3.py** and **RPC APIs** for safe, authenticated Solana interactions, including transaction signing, nonce management, and status tracking.

- **Fault-Tolerant Architecture**  
  Handles transaction retries, duplicate prevention, and error recovery for uninterrupted synchronization during volatile market conditions.

- **Configurable Strategy Layer**  
  Supports customizable strategies‚Äîmirror trades, percentage-based copy, or selective asset replication‚Äîvia YAML or CLI configuration.
