# MarketMinerAI

MarketMinerAI is an experimental toolkit that pairs a lightweight promotional site with an automation script designed to react to Solana wallet activity. The project packages a simple marketing presence alongside rapid-response trading helpers so that operators can monitor wallets, surface new opportunities, and trigger orders with minimal manual effort.

## Key Highlights

- **Responsive landing page:** A static marketing page communicates the vision of MarketMinerAI while providing a clear entry point for visitors.
- **Solana trading automation:** The `finalDraftV3.py` script watches wallet balances and reacts to updates by attempting coordinated buy and sell orders via Pump.fun and Raydium.
- **Clean workspace organization:** The repository separates interface assets from automation logic, making it easier to locate and iterate on each component.

```

## Getting Started

1. **Review the interface assets** within `trading_interface/` to customize the messaging, styling, or client-side behavior of the landing page.
2. **Inspect `finalDraftV3.py`** to understand the automation flow. The script listens for wallet balance events and coordinates orders through third-party services. Adjust endpoints, keys, or strategy logic to suit your deployment environment.
3. **Set up a Python environment** if you intend to run the automation locally:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # provide dependencies as needed
   ```
4. **Run the automation script** once dependencies and environment variables are configured:
   ```bash
   python trading_interface/finalDraftV3.py
   ```

## Operational Notes

- The automation script assumes access to Solana wallet credentials and the ability to interact with Pump.fun and Raydium APIs. Review the script carefully before executing it against real funds.
- Logging and error handling can be extended to integrate with your monitoring stack or alerting workflows.
- Consider rate limits, API keys, and network latency when adapting the script for production use.
